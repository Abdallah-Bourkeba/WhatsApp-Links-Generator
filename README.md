# WhatsApp Links Generator

This is a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate WhatsApp links. You can create a link that will open a chat with a specified phone number and pre-filled message.

## How to Generate a WhatsApp Link

To generate a WhatsApp link, use the following format:
```
https://wa.me/<phone_number>?text=<message>
```

- `phone_number`: The phone number in international format without any spaces or special characters.
